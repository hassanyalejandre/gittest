I've been a part of Coding Dojo for the past month, and I have to be honest; it has not been a smooth ride.
The learning curve of the material, in addition to the rate at which we are being taught, is quite steep.
However, like I've mentioned in every survey that Coding Dojo asks to be filled, the environment and philosophy is a substantial reason as to why I chose Coding Dojo over other bootcamps. All the students are serious about what they want to learn, and the instructors waste no time at all. Although it's been extremely difficult, and I've wanted to give up at times, I do have to say that its a great place to learn software development. 

Also, Interstellar, October Sky and How to Train a Dragon happen to be some of my favorite movies. I've been secretly waiting for SAO: Ordinal Scale to come out on DVD/Blueray; I can't believe that I totally missed the showings during March. I'm assuming that because it's an anime, they only have limited showings in theaters. I can't wait for the third season to come out!
