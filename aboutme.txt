I've been a part of Coding Dojo for the past month, and I have to be honest; it has not been a smooth ride.
The learning curve of the material, in addition to the rate at which we are being taught, is quite steep.
However, like I've mentioned in every survey that Coding Dojo asks to be filled, the environment and philosophy is a substantial reason as to why I chose Coding Dojo over other bootcamps. All the students are serious about what they want to learn, and the instructors waste no time at all. Although it's been extremely difficult, and I've wanted to give up at times, I do have to say that its a great place to learn software development. 

I'm not sure about this, but when one reverts a git file, does that also affect the file itself? I don't think so, but somehow, the synopsys that I wrote in response to the movie promped wasn't saved.
